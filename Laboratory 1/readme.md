# First laboratory
## Compulsory
- done during the laboratory, the single non-basic thing used was ```parseInt(String[], int)``` to convert to decimal
## Homework
- done during last week
- created an Utils class for better readability and cleaner code
- used ```StringBuilder()``` for better performance in loops
- used ```ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(int, int)``` for a closer to "true random" experience
- used the ```nanoTime()``` function to measure the execution time of the code in the _Homework_ class
## Bonus
- started work on the _Bonus_ class
- made a _DFS_ algo for the adjacency matrix, but it only finds a maximum sequence of 2 everytime (because it's an old algo for _LIP_)
- could've finished by now, but I didn't really have time for it
